Hangman Game (Python)

A simple and interactive command-line Hangman game written in Python. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word one letter at a time while keeping track of wrong attempts.

#Objective

Guess the secret word before your 6 attempts run out.

#How the Game Works

A random word is selected from a predefined list.

The player guesses one letter at a time.

Correct letters are revealed in their positions.

Incorrect guesses reduce your remaining attempts.

The game ends when:

You guess all letters (Win)

You run out of attempts (Lose)

#Features
